# shop-for-me
A simple web app to ask for help to shop

## Why?
The received the challenge from a friend Tobias Schwarz with the blog post from Jon https://jonworth.eu/specification-shop-for-me-wordpress-plugin-for-coronavirus-community-response/.

First I wanted to join a challenge in the communication category. But after scanning the idea, I thought this should be pretty straight forward.

## Let's start
So I took the challenge and started right away instead of waiting for a slack link from #WirVsVirusHack
My wordpress knowledge is so so but since I love laravel, I am using it.

You can find the challenge in the AirTable https://airtable.com/shrs71ccUVKyvLlUA/tbl6Br4W3IyPGk1jt/viw7AlEju6qFtXJqL?blocks=hide under ID #435

Stay tuned and updated.
